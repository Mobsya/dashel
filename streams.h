	\section IntroSec Introduction
	
	DaSHEL is a cross-platform DAta Stream Helper Encapsulation Library.
	It provides a unified access to TCP/IP, serial port, and files streams.
	It also allows a server application to wait for any activity
	on any combination of those streams.
	
	Streams is licensed under a modified BSD license, which is a permissive open source license.
	Yet, if you find bugs or do some improvements, please let us know.
	
	\section TargetNamingSec Targets Naming
	
	To construct a new Client, or to listen connections in a Server, you have to specify a target.
	A target is a string which describes a file, a TCP/IP address/port, or a serial port.
	This string consists of the type of the target followed by a comma separated list of parameters.
	This list is contains key-values pair, with a predifined order such that keys can be omitted (but if a key is present, all subsequent entries must have an explicit key).
	Its general syntax is thus \c "protocol:[param1key=]param1value:...:[paramNkey=]paramNvalue".
	
	The following protocols are available:
	\li \c file : local files
	\li \c tcp : TCP/IP
	\li \c ser : serial port
	
	The file protocol accepts only one key:
	\li \c name : name of the file, including the path
	
	The tcp protocol accepts the following keys, in this implicit order:
	\li \c address : IPV4 address
	\li \c port : port
	
	The ser protocol accepts the following keys, in this implicit order:
	\li \c port : serial port number, starting from 1, default 1
	\li \c baud : baud rate, default 115200
	\li \c stop : stop bits count (1 or 2), default 1
	\li \c parity : parity type (none, even, odd, mark, space), default none
	\li \c fc : flow control type, (none, soft, hard), default none
	
	The serial port is always configured for 8 bits transfers
	
	\section UsageSec Usage
	
	Streams is very easy to use. Just add streams.h and streams.cpp to your project and enjoy.
