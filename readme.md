## Usage

To learn how to use Dashel, visit http://aseba-community.github.io/dashel.

## Compilation

To compile Dashel, you need CMake 2.6 or later (http://www.cmake.org/).
The CMake website provides documentation on how to use CMake on the different
platforms at https://cmake.org/runningcmake.

### Unix

If you are on Unix and lazy, and just want to compile Dashel without any
additional thinking, type the following commands in Dashel sources directory:

	cmake . && make

If this does not work, then read the aforementioned web page.

On Linux, to enumerate serial ports properly, install libudev (http://www.kernel.org/pub/linux/utils/kernel/hotplug/libudev/).
